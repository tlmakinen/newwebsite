Hi I'm Lucas. I'm a PhD student at Imperial College London studying cosmology, AI, and music. My research combines deep learning, statistics, and astrophysics to accelerate understanding of our universe's origins. 

Outside of science, I'm a jazz and classical trumpet player. As a result, I am also interested in the evolving intersection of AI-driven music generation, and its implications for musicians.

In my spare time I study languages â€“ reach out to me in English, French, Finnish, or Italian.
